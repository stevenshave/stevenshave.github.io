Hi there! I'm a cheminformatician/data scientist/AIML-in drug discovery enthusiast at SandboxAQ, formerly GSK & the University of Edinburgh. I'm focused on building and applying AI/ML techniques in drug discovery.

In 2020 I became a UKRI Innovation Scholar in AI/ML for Drug discovery and was seconded to GSK from the University of Edinburgh, where I worked on approaches for multiomics integration, merging data and flagging compounds likely to fail at the later clinical stages of the drug discovery process.

The future of science is FAIR and open (source, data, review & collaborations).

Purpose
======
The purpose of this (very much a work in progress) site is organising and keeping a clean record of papers, talks, teaching and thoughts.
