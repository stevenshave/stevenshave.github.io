Hi there! I'm a cheminformatician/data scientist/AIML advocate at the University of Edinburgh, focused on applying AIML techniques to early stage drug discovery programs. I'm currently seconded to GSK (UK) where I work on approaches for multiomics integration, merging data and flagging compounds likely to fail at the later clinical stages of the drug discovery process.  

Purpose
======
The purpose of this (very much a work in progress) site is organising and keeping a clean record of papers, talks, teaching and thoughts.
