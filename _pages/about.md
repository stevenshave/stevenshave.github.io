Hi there! I'm a cheminformatician/data scientist/AIML advocate at the University of Edinburgh, focused on applying AI/ML techniques to early stage drug discovery programs.

In 2020 I became a UKRI Innovation Scholar in AI/ML for Drug discovery. I am currently seconded to GSK where I work on approaches for multiomics integration, merging data and flagging compounds likely to fail at the later clinical stages of the drug discovery process.

Whilst predominantly working with cell painting and high content imaging data from phenotypic screens, recent work focuses on integrating multiomics views from imaging, proteomics, transcriptomics, small molecule structure and polypharmacology, applying novel architectures for integration and standardising workflows for application to running discovery programs.

The future of science is FAIR and open (source, data, review & collaborations).


Purpose
======
The purpose of this (very much a work in progress) site is organising and keeping a clean record of papers, talks, teaching and thoughts.
